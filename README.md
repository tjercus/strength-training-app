# Strength Training App

This project is a throwback to circa 2005 when I first started building Single Pace Applications.
Then we used jQuery to do direct DOM manipulation instead of render framework like React, which did
not exists at the time.

Instead of jQuery I've used [Saladbar](https://github.com/wking-io/saladbar) which allows for 
functional programming with ramda and ramda-fantasy.

Demo app of some concepts:
- retro XP theme
- no mainstream GUI frameworks: 
- just an HTML template and some functional wrappers around the DOM (saladbar + custom extensions)

# Run it
